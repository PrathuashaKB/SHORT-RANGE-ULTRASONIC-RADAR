# SHORT-RANGE-ULTRASONIC-RADAR
Technical project, a simple radar using the ultrasonic sensor to detect objects within the short range.
### About :
Radar is an object detection system that uses electromagnetic waves to identify range, altitude, direction, or speed of both moving and fixed objects such as aircraft, ships, vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. When we use ultrasonic waves instead of electromagnetic waves, we call it ultrasonic radar.
In this technical project, we make a simple radar using the ultrasonic sensor, this radar works by measuring a range from 3cm to 40 cm as non-contact distance, with angle range between 15˚ and 165˚.The movement of the sensor is controlled by using a small servo motor. Information received from the sensor will be used by “Processing Development Environment” software to illustrate the result on a PC screen.
